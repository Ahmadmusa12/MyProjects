# Single Page Application (SPA)

This is a starter React app built using Vite. It runs as a Single Page Application (SPA), meaning all interactions happen without full page reloads. The current setup demonstrates dynamic behavior with a simple counter powered by React state.

**Tech Used:** React, JavaScript, Vite  
**How I Built It:** Bootstrapped the app with Vite, coded in VS Code, and tested locally.
