# Mileage Converter

I built a mobile mileage-to-kilometer converter app using React Native and Expo. It lets users input either unit (miles or kilometers) and instantly see the converted result. I managed state with React Hooks, implemented the conversion logic, and styled the UI for clean mobile usability.

**Tech Used:** React Native, Expo, JavaScript  
**How I Built It:** Developed on macOS, tested live using the Expo Go app on my phone.
