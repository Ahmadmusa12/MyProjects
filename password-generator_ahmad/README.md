# Password Generator

I created a customizable Strong Password Generator using Python. This tool allows users to generate secure passwords of any length, with options to include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. I built and edited the code in TextEdit, then ran it using Python via the Terminal with command-line interaction. This project demonstrates my ability to write functional Python scripts, handle user input, and apply cybersecurity best practices like entropy and randomness.

**Tech Used:** Python  
**How I Built It:** Wrote code in TextEdit on macOS, ran it in the Terminal.
